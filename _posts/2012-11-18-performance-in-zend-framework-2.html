summary: A listing of options to improve Performance using Zend Framework 2
---

<div class="row">
    <p>
        I am going to list options here on how to improve the Performance. This will be an ongoing list wchich i will keep updated while doing performance improvements.
    </p>
    <h1>Autoloader Classmap</h1>
    <p>As described by Rob Allen on his <a href="http://akrabat.com/zend-framework-2/using-zendloaderautoloader/">Blog</a>.</>
    <pre>
The class map autoloader is a high performance autoloader. It uses class maps, which are simply associative arrays of each classname to the name of the file disk that contains that class.
    </pre>
    This is a very simple process and takes just a few minutes to generate and include the classmaps for each module you have created.

    <h1>Template Map</h1>
    <p>Most people use the 'template_path_stack' during development. As pointed out by the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.0/en/modules/zend.view.quick-start.html#configuration">manual</a>, this can introduce a performance expense.
    </p>
    <pre>
This is a nice solution for rapid application
development, but potentially introduces performance expense in
production due to the number of stat calls necessary.
    </pre>
    <p>Once development is completed, consider putting your view's into the template_map as described in the manual.</p>

    <p>This is just a quick write up and i will continue to update this with more options. If you feel anything is missing or should be mentioned, please do not hesitate to comment so i can keep this list updated. Thanks for reading!</p>
