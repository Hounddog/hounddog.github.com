        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>I want to share my thoughts with the community.</p>
        <p>
            I have been working as a Developer for a long time now without my own page.
            So i decided to create one on Github and with a short discussion thx to <a href="http://ocramius.github.com/blog/moving-my-blog-to-jekyll/" target="_blank">Marco Pivetta </a>. I copied his page and quickly dived into the code and found it very simple to setup.
        </p>

            Within just a few hours i was able to setup and modify my page. So here i am finally. Keep watching for updates.
